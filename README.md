# Movie-Website Project
 A website to compare films' properties
Firstly, I created a searchbar and connected to an API. Afterwards I am able to read films' data. 
Secondly, I created another searchbar for comparing films.
Thirdly, I try to make my code more clear, more re-usable.
I added comparing algorithm, bulma css' classes helped me a lot. It make it more easy to switch classes.
